      <h1>Chicken</h1>

      <p>
        The chicken <b>(Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a type of domesticated
        fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Chickens are
        one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
        population of 23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19 billion
        in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or
        domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food
        (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.
        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chicke ns
        were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
        BC)

        year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in the United States, Canada,
        Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters. Males
        less than a year old are cockerels.[10] Castrated or neutered roosters
        are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in
        some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens, and
        younger females as pullets,[11] although in the egg-laying industry, a
        pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of
        age. The young are called chicks. In Australia and New Zealand (also
        sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /tʃʊk/ to describe
        all ages and both sexes.[12] Chicken originally referred to young
        domestic fowl.[13] The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl,
        or just fowl. This use of chicken survives in the phrase Hen and
        Chickens, sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and
        to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea
        (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The hen and chickens was also
        a name for the pentacycle, an early design of cargo cycle which had a
        large central driving wheel surrounded by four small stabiliser wheels.
        In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are referred to by the
        slang term yardbird.[14]

      <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>

      <p>
        Lorem*15 Chickens are omnivores.[15] In the wild, they often scratch at
        the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as
        lizards, small snakes,[16] or young mice.[17 The average chicken may
        live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[18] The world's
        oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of
        16 years according to the Guinness World Records.[19] Roosters can
        usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long
        flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and
        backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than
        those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the
        Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers,
        the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking
        at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's
        legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks
        may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on
        their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin
        either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and
        other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles.
        Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most
        breeds these are more prominent in males. A muff or beard is a mutation
        found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the
        chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard. Domestic chickens are
        not capable of long distance flight, although lighter chickens are
        generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or
        into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally
        fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to
        flee perceived danger.

        <h3>Behavior(Article)</h3>
        <p>
          Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
          communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
          Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
          "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food
          access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock
          causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking
          order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an
          existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[20] When a rooster
          finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by
          clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food.
          This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their
          chicks and encourage them to eat. A rooster's crowing is a loud and
          sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other
          roosters.[21] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden
          disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying
          an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different
          warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or
          on the ground.[22] Courtship To initiate courting, some roosters may
          dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often
          lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[23] The dance triggers
          a response in the hen[23] and when she responds to his "call", the
          rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. More
          specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence: 1.
          Male approaching the hen. 2. Male pre-copulatory waltzing. 3. Male
          waltzing. 4. Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or
          running away (if unwilling to copulate). 5. Male mounting. 6. Male
          treading with both feet on hen's back. 7. Male tail bending (following
          successful copulation).[24] Nesting and laying behaviour Chicken eggs
          vary in colour depending on the breed, and sometimes, the hen,
          typically ranging from bright white to shades of brown and even blue,
          green, light pinkish and recently reported purple (found in South
          Asia) (Araucana varieties). Chicks before their first outing Hens will
          often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been
          known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. The result
          of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred
          locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens
          will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not
          unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the
          same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly
          determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each
          other. There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either
          solitary or gregarious nesters.[25] A chick sitting in a person's hand
          Broodiness Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a
          clutch is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are
          then said to "go broody". The broody hen will stop laying and instead
          will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually
          about 12 eggs). She will "sit" or "set" on the nest, protesting or
          pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave
          the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe. While brooding, the hen
          maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as
          turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation. To
          stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the
          nest. To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage
          with an open wire floor.[citation needed]
